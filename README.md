# CIV102-Bridges

Project Description
Engineering Science undegrad students in the University of Toronto are required to take a civil engineering course, CIV102.
This course largely focuses on the design of bridges, and as a final project, students are required to build a 
bridge out of a limited quantity of (*dimensions here*) matboard. 
For my group's project, we decided that the ability to quickly compare different proposed cross-sections would be hugely beneficial, as it would save time and allow us to focus on proper construction of the bridge. Furthermore, I wanted to take on a compsci project such as this to enhance my learning. Thus, the idea behind this project was born.

Initially written in Spyder

Requires numPy package

ps. as advice to any out there building matboard bridges, even with these nice calcs and such, u have to make sure to reinforce the hell out of your bridges. Diaphragms and reinforcements and a nice tub of glue will get u far
