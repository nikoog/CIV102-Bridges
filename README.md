# CIV102-Bridges

Project Description
Engineering Science undegrad students in the University of Toronto are required to take a civil engineering course, CIV102.
This course largely focuses on the design of bridges, and as a final project, students are required to build a 
bridge out of a limited quantity of (*dimensions here*) matboard. 
For my group's project, we decided that the ability to quickly compare different proposed cross-sections would be hugely beneficial, as it would save time and allow us to focus on proper construction of the bridge. Furthermore, I wanted to take on a compsci project such as this to enhance my learning. Thus, the idea behind this project was born.

Initially written with Spyder (anaconda)
Requires numpy package

i didn't wanna do bridge calcs so let's make python do it :D
